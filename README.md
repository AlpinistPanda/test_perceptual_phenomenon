This is a data analysis for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.

It uses one tailed, dependent t-test to find out if it takes longer to read a set of numbers in an incongruent case than a congruent case. Congruent case meaning, the colors of the words are matching with the words itself where the words are just bunch of colors. In incongruent case, these dont match.
